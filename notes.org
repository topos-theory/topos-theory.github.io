* notes to self
- use run.sh to download dependencies with bundler and run a local instance
  ./run.sh
- there is an example with markdown in _drafts/2014-06-10-see-pixyll-in-action.md
- put custom css in css/custom.css
- skipping the {{ site.url }} variable
  - assuming that site will only ever be displayed at the root URL of the domain
    - see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/
  - why: makes it easier to iterate locally
    - ie. to see images locally
- add a markdown="1" attribute to an HTML element to have the insides be markdown
