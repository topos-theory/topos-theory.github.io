* notes to self
- use run.sh to download dependencies with bundler and run a local instance
  ./run.sh
- there is an example with markdown in _drafts/2014-06-10-see-pixyll-in-action.md
- put custom css in css/custom.css
- skipping the {{ site.url }} variable
  - assuming that site will only ever be displayed at the root URL of the domain
    - see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/
  - why: makes it easier to iterate locally
    - ie. to see images locally
* TODOs
- consider http://doctoc.herokuapp.com/ for table of contents
* resources
- https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
- http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables
  - to generate markdown tables
