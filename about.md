Topos brings scientists from around the bay area to live together in SF and work on interesting problems at the intersection of fields that don't ordinarily communicate well. We host workshops, invited talks, dinners, etc. on subjects spanning quantum gravity, deep reinforcement learning, categorical linear algebra, stem cell therapies of lung cancer and many others.
