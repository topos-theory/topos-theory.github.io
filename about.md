Topos is focused on spurring fundamental scientific and technological progress and is currently experimenting with how to support creative problem solving in a co-living setting. In particular, we aim to support resident scientists complete several month significant projects of theirs while not conflicting with 9-5 life.

### Space ###

To support quiet and collaborative work, our home has a quiet library space with views of the bay and ocean as well as a vibrant collaborative floor where we regularly host conferences, reading groups, dinners, workshops, and lectures. On weekends, we operate a science hostel to host visitors.

### Culture ###

We devote great care to ensure our culture supports people learning and studying in their own way without any implicit ability-driven social status. We think this helps create the relaxed focus that accelerates learning and increases the enjoyment of it.

### Fun ###

We organize camping trips, regular bonfires, DJ Hawking jam sessions, and (very) occasional < Rave \| Function> house parties. Spontaneity is a core value.

### Diversity ###

Academia propels the narrow cutting-edge with expensive yet specialized resources. Topos focuses on teaching fundamentals and providing daily exposure to a breadth of ideas and exposition from all scientific fields. We have, for example, an ongoing lecture series devoted to novel expositions of old topics.

In sum, we believe that co-living is powerful raw material for personal and scientific growth. We are actively testing hypotheses for how that material can be best developed to support scientists. By doing so, we hope to spur breakthroughs.

We look for people with the drive to greatly improve during their time at Topos as residents or visitors. Please email <a href="mailto:info@topos.house?Subject=Co-living" target="_top">info@topos.house</a> for more information.
